# Batch_LCModel_Analysis_Toolkit

The Batch LCModel Analysis Toolkit is a collection of open-source MATLAB (v. 2018a) functions available for facilitating batch linear combination modeling in (now also open-source!) program LCModel. 

### Features
- Convert INSPECTOR-format .mat free induction decay (FID) files into LCModel .raw files
- Batch-write LCModel CONTROL files from a template for a directory of .raw files
- Convert a directory of LCModel CONTROL files into a Linux .sh script for easy batch calls to LCModel 
- Collate a directory of LCModel .csv outputs into a single master file for convenient downstream analysis
