# Batch LCModel Analysis Toolkit

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Batch LCModel Analysis Toolkit is a collection of open-source MATLAB (v. 2018a-23b) and R (v. 4.0.5) functions available for facilitating batch linear combination modeling in (now also open-source!) program LCModel. 

### Features
- Extract individual free induction decay (FID) as .mat files from an INSPECTOR-format basis file
- Convert INSPECTOR-format .mat FIDs into LCModel .raw files
- Add constant Lorentzian line broadening to a directory of LCModel .raw or INSPECTOR .mat files
- Read LCModel .raw files into MATLAB for further processing 
- Convert .txt FIDs exported from Bruker ParaVision 360 spectral visualization and processing tool into LCModel .raw files
- Batch-write LCModel CONTROL files from a template for a directory of .raw files
- Convert a directory of LCModel CONTROL files into a Linux .sh script for easy batch calls to LCModel 
- Collate a directory of LCModel .csv outputs into a single master file for convenient downstream analysis 
- Collate the first page of each file in a directory of LCModel result PDFs into a single master file for convenient batch persual
